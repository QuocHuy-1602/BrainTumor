Image Dataset of Brain Tumors: Semantic Division
The Tumor Segmentation Dataset was created especially for the Semantic Segmentation-focused TumorSeg Computer Vision Project. The project's goal is to precisely identify tumor spots in medical images by utilizing cutting-edge methods.

Synopsis of the Project:
The goal of the TumorSeg Computer Vision Project is to classify each pixel in an image as belonging to a tumor or a non-tumor zone through a process known as semantic segmentation. An accurate comprehension of the spatial distribution of malignancies inside medical imaging is possible because to this fine-grained technique.

Courses:
There are two classes in this dataset:
Class 0 (Non-Tumor): In the medical imaging, the non-tumor labeled pixels show regions free of tumors.
Class 1 (Tumor): Areas where tumors are found are represented by pixels identified as tumors.

Use of the Dataset: To train and assess semantic segmentation models for tumor detection, researchers and practitioners in the field of medical image analysis can utilize this dataset. The segmentation work is made simpler by the binary classification into classes for tumors and non-tumors.
